# socialnetworkapi

## Purpose

The purpose of this app is to operate as the backend code for a social media start up company. This lays the framework for api commands for users, friends, posts(thoughts) and replys to those thoughts(reactions). We used NoSQL for this so that the website could handle large amounts of unstructured data.
